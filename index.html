                        Smoking leads to disease and disability and harms 
                        nearly every organ of the body.
                        More than 16 million Americans are living with a 
                        disease caused by smoking. For every person who dies 
                        because of smoking, at least 30 people live with a 
                        serious smoking-related illness.

                        Secondhand smoke exposure contributes to approximately 41,000 
                        deaths among nonsmoking adults and 400 deaths in infants each year.

                                Cancer refers to diseases in which abnormal cells divide out of 
                                control and are able to invade other tissues. Cancer cells can spread to 
                                other parts of the body through the blood and lymph systems, which help the 
                                body get rid of toxins
                            </p>

                                There are more than 100 different types of cancer. Most cancers are named for 
                                the organ or type of cell in which they start—for example, lung cancer begins in the lung and laryngeal cancer begins in the larynx

                                Heart disease and stroke are cardiovascular (heart and blood vessel) diseases (CVDs)
                            </p>

                                Heart disease includes several types of heart conditions. 
                                The most common type in the United States is coronary heart disease 
                                (also known as coronary artery disease), which is narrowing 
                                of the blood vessels that carry blood to the heart. This can cause:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Chest pain</li>
                                <li>Heart attack (when blood flow to the heart becomes blocked and a section of the heart muscle is damaged or dies)</li>
                                <li>Heart failure (when the heart cannot pump enough blood and oxygen to support other organs)</li>
                                <li>Arrhythmia (when the heart beats too fast, too slow, or irregularly)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                A stroke occurs when the blood supply to the brain is blocked or when a blood vessel in the brain bursts, causing brain tissue to die.7 Stroke can cause 
                                disability (such as paralysis, muscle weakness, trouble speaking, 
                                memory loss)8 or death.

                                Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) refers to a group of diseases that cause airflow blockage and breathing-related problems. COPD includes emphysema; chronic bronchitis; and in some cases, asthma

                            <h2>How Is Smoking Related to COPD?</h2>
                            <p>
                                COPD is usually caused by smoking Smoking accounts for as many 
                                as 8 out of 10 COPD-related deaths.6 However, as many as 1 out of 4 
                                Americans with COPD never smoked cigarettes.5
                                Smoking during childhood and teenage years can 
                                slow how lungs grow and develop. This can increase the risk of 
                                developing COPD in adulthood

                                The best way to prevent COPD is to never start smoking, and if you smoke, 
                                quit. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you 
                                quit. Also, stay away from secondhand smoke, which is smoke 
                                from burning tobacco products, such as cigarettes, cigars, or 
                                pipes.6,9,10  Secondhand smoke also is smoke that has been

                                Carbon monoxide in tobacco smoke can keep the developing baby from getting enough oxygen. 
                                Tobacco smoke also contains other chemicals that can harm unborn babies.

                        E-cigarettes are sometimes called “e-cigs,” “vapes,” “e-hookahs,” “vape pens,” and 
                        “electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS).” Some e-cigarettes look 
                        like regular cigarettes, cigars, or pipes. Some look like USB flash drives, 
                        pens, and other everyday items.

                                Nearly all e-cigarette products sold contain nicotine, which is the 
                                same addictive drug found in other tobacco products, including cigarettes 
                                and cigars. The nicotine content 
                                information on e-cigarette packaging is often misleading or inaccurate.

                                Nicotine is highly addictive and can harm adolescent brain development, 
                                which continues into the mid-20s. Compared with older adults, the brains 
                                of youth and young adults are more vulnerable to nicotine’s harmful health 
                                effects. These include nicotine 
                                addiction and potentially reduced impulse control, mood disorders, and poor

                                CDC, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), state and local health departments, and other clinical and public health partners are continuing to monitor 
                                e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury (EVALI).

                            <p>
                                If EVALI is suspected, health care providers should ask about the use of 
                                e-cigarette, or vaping, products in a confidential and nonjudgmental 
                                manner.   The most critical step in assessing EVALI is to ask patients 
                                about recent use of e-cigarette, or vaping, products. If product use is 
                                confirmed, ask about the types of substances used 
                                (e.g., [tetrahydrocannabinol] THC and nicotine) and where they were obtained.
                            </p>
